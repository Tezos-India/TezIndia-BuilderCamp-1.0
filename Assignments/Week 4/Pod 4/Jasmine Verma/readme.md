User interface: [https://bejewelled-youtiao-7674cf.netlify.app/]

How it works-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The platform allows users to upload their images and mint them as NFTs. Here's a brief overview of how the platform works:
The user uploads an image.
The image is stored on IPFS.
The user enters the required information (name, description, etc.).
The user mints the NFT.
The NFT is created and stored on the blockchain.

Features------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The platform has the following features:
Upload images: Users can upload their images to mint as NFTs.
Unique NFTs: Each NFT is unique and can only be minted once.
IPFS integration: Images are stored on IPFS for efficient and decentralized storage.
Meta-data: Users can enter meta-data for their NFTs, such as name, description, and tags.

Technologies Used---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The platform is built using the following technologies:
SmartPy: The smart contract is written in SmartPy.
React.js: The user interface is built using React.js.
IPFS: Images are stored on IPFS for efficient and decentralized storage.

Getting Started------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
